      "description": "As of tomorrow, I will have completed my first three weeks at Tableau. It feels like just yesterday I was getting picked up by Daren and Cameron, my mentors, at the main office for my first day. I was so excited getting to meet everyone and seeing where I would be spending my summer. I couldn't believe I even got my own desk!! Immediately I started trying to absorb all the information I could about Tableau as I wanted to be able to be the best intern I could be. Apparently I did a good job studying as I passed my Bronze certification this week. It's so relieving to have that done and now I can start learning even more complex things in Tableau. Before leaving this summer, I have a few goals I want to accomplish. 1. Complete Silver Certification: I want to complete this by the end of my time here as I want to be as fluent in this software as the rest of the Product Consultants. 2. Create Something Cool: I've seen the amazing visualizations others have been able to accomplish in Tableau and I hope I can create something great too. One thing I believe will really help me create beautiful dashboards is learning more on calculations, so I'm going to focus on getting good on those.  3. Have Fun!  I want to not only learn new skills, I want to have an enjoyable experience. Already I've realized this will be my easiest goal to accomplish. Everyone has been so welcoming and kind to me, as well as light hearted and good-humored. I look forward to coming to work every day.I want to make sure to thank everyone for a great first couple weeks. I was apprehensive about these weeks but I quickly realized I had nothing to worry about. Everyone has been so kind and welcoming to me and I am so appreciative of that. Big thank you to my mentors Daren and Cameron, you have both gone out of your way to help me in so many ways! I'm lucky to have you guys around to help me! Also, special thanks to those who listened to my mock bronze calls, you all helped me pass my demo today! Thank you :)"

      "description": "As a first entry to my blog, I wanted to go over some background about me and how I came to be an intern here at Tableau. For starters, I was born in Longview, Washington and I graduated from Robert A Long high school in 2014. No worries if you’ve never heard of it, you're not missing out on much. I grew up riding and competing with horses and playing sports like soccer and track. But I also had a strong passion for technology. I realized I wanted to have a career in technology in my freshmen year of high school after watching a documentary on Watson, the famous question answering computer. I wanted to be able to create something that could help others as well as provide others with enjoyment. I started teaching myself to code and started taking computer programming classes in high school. From there,  I went on to enroll in the University of Washington with my sights set on a computer science degree. While worrying and stressing over computer science prerequisites, I heard about the Informatics degree. After some research, I switched gears and started working on applications for the Information school. I learned that informatics was the study of not just computer science, but also of how people interact and use technology. It was my dream degree, I could learn how to create things like websites and databases while also learning about cybersecurity and project management. I was accepted into the program in June 2015. The Information school is also what first introduced me to Tableau. Classes I had taken and other students I had met often mentioned Tableau. After reading more about this company, I realized why informatics students loved their technology so much. Tableau is in fact the essence of information science, it gives people the chance to view and analyze data and information. While looking for an internship, the idea of Tableau had crossed my mind and I visited the application website many times, but I thought there was no way a company like that would choose someone like me. I figured they already had thousands of applications to look through as everyone in my major seemed to be applying there, so what was the use? I worked at the Apple store in University Village during my spare time at UW. My mom pushed me to apply since it would be a good starting position if I wanted a job at a technology company. Of course, my mom was right once again because that’s when I met a Tableau Employee in the Ops department. She gave me her email and asked me to reach out to her about internships. She set me up with the recruiting team and my interviews began. After three different interviews and creating a workbook, I was offered the position as Product Consulting Intern. I was so excited I could hardly believe it. I was about to start my dream internship. And that’s the story of how we got here."

      "description": "During my first week at my internship, my mentor assigned me the task of creating a dashboard using data from a horse sales website. Because of my passion for horses, he thought this would be a great way for me to get to experience and use Tableau. I started out creating something simple, but progressively grew to creating something more and more complex. Now I have even included parameters to create options for choosing different types of graph and images that change based on which breed of horse the user selects."
