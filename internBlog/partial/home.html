		  <h2>My Story</h2>
		  <img id="story-img" src="img/horse.jpg">
		  <p>As a first entry to my blog, I wanted to go over some background about me and how I came to be an intern here at Tableau. For starters, I was born in Longview, Washington and I graduated from Robert A Long high school in 2014. No worries if you’ve never heard of it, you're not missing out on much. I grew up riding and competing with horses and playing sports like soccer and track. But I also had a strong passion for technology. I realized I wanted to have a career in technology in my freshmen year of high school after watching a documentary on Watson, the famous question answering computer. I wanted to be able to create something that could help others as well as provide others with enjoyment. I started teaching myself to code and started taking computer programming classes in high school. From there,  I went on to enroll in the University of Washington with my sights set on a computer science degree. While worrying and stressing over computer science prerequisites, I heard about the Informatics degree. After some research, I switched gears and started working on applications for the Information school. I learned that informatics was the study of not just computer science, but also of how people interact and use technology. It was my dream degree, I could learn how to create things like websites and databases while also learning about cybersecurity and project management. I was accepted into the program in June 2015. 
        </p>

        <p>The Information school is also what first introduced me to Tableau. Classes I had taken and other students I had met often mentioned Tableau. After reading more about this company, I realized why informatics students loved their technology so much. Tableau is in fact the essence of information science, it gives people the chance to view and analyze data and information. While looking for an internship, the idea of Tableau had crossed my mind and I visited the application website many times, but I thought there was no way a company like that would choose someone like me. I figured they already had thousands of applications to look through as everyone in my major seemed to be applying there, so what was the use? 
        </p>

        <p>I worked at the Apple store in University Village during my spare time at UW. My mom pushed me to apply since it would be a good starting position if I wanted a job at a technology company. Of course, my mom was right once again because that’s when I met a Tableau Employee in the Ops department. She gave me her email and asked me to reach out to her about internships. She set me up with the recruiting team and my interviews began. After three different interviews and creating a workbook, I was offered the position as Product Consulting Intern. I was so excited I could hardly believe it. I was about to start my dream internship! 
        </p>

        <p>And that’s the story of how we got here.
