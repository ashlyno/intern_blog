		  <p>This is my blog about my experiences as a Product Consulting Intern at Tableau in Seattle, Washington. For those of you who do not know what a product consultant is, we are basically the Tableau experts. We offer support for others in our product and figure out how to create complex dashboards to help customers. I started on June 20th, 2016. I created this blog to document my experiences, thoughts, as well as the work I have done. Enjoy!
